            <p> In a small village, a little boy lived with his father and mother. He was the only son.The parents of the little boy were very depressed due to his bad temper. The boy used to get angry very soon and taunt others with his words. His bad temper made him use words that hurt others. He scolded kids, neighbours and even his friends due to anger. His friends and neighbours avoided him, and his parents were really worried about him.
            His mother and father advised him many times to control his anger and develop kindness. Unfortunately, all their attempts failed. Finally, the boy’s father came up with an idea.
            One day, his father gave him a huge bag of nails. He asked his son to hammer one nail to the fence every time he became angry and lost his temper. The little boy found it amusing and accepted the task.
            Every time he lost his temper, he ran to the fence and hammered a nail. His anger drove him to hammer nails on the fence 30 times on the first day! After the next few days, the number of nails hammered on the fence was reduced to half. The little boy found it very difficult to hammer the nails and decided to control his temper.
            Gradually, the number of nails hammered to the fence was reduced and the day arrived when no nail was hammered! The boy did not lose his temper at all that day. For the next several days, he did not lose his temper, and so did not hammer any nail.
            Now, his father told him to remove the nails each time the boy controlled his anger. Several days passed and the boy was able to pull out most of the nails from the fence. However, there remained a few nails that he could not pull out.
            The boy told his father about it. The father appreciated him and asked him pointing to a hole, “What do you see there?”
            The boy replied, “a hole in the fence!”
            He told the boy, “The nails were your bad temper and they were hammered on people. You can remove the nails but the holes in the fence will remain. The fence will never look the same. It has scars all over. Some nails cannot even be pulled out. You can stab a man with a knife, and say sorry later, but the wound will remain there forever. Your bad temper and angry words were like that! Words are more painful than physical abuse! Use words for good purposes. Use them to grow relationships. Use them to show the love and kindness in your heart!”
            Moral – Unkind words cause lasting damage: Let our words be kind and sweet.

            <p> One beautiful spring morning, a merchant loaded his donkey with bags of salt to go to the market, in order to sell the salt. The merchant and his donkey were walking along together. They had not walked far when they reached a river on the way.
            Unfortunately, the donkey slipped and fell into the river. As it scrambled up the bank of the river, it noticed that the bags of salt loaded on his back had become lighter.
            There was nothing the merchant could do except return home, where he loaded his donkey with more bags of salt. As they reached the slippery riverbank again, the donkey fell into the river, this time deliberately. Thus the salt was wasted again.
            By now the merchant knew the donkey’s trick. He wanted to teach the animal a lesson. As he returned home the second time with the donkey, the merchant loaded bags of sponges on its back.
            The duo set out on their trip to the market a third time. On reaching the river, the donkey very cleverly fell into the water again. But now, instead of the load becoming lighter, it became heavier.
            The merchant laughed at the donkey and said, “You foolish donkey, your trick has been discovered. You should know that you cannot fool anyone too many times.”

            <p> Long ago, people lived happily under the rule of a king. The people of the kingdom were very happy as they led a very prosperous life with an abundance of wealth and no misfortunes.
			Once, the king decided to go visiting places of historical importance and pilgrim centres at distant places. He decided to travel by foot to interact with his people. People of distant places were very happy to have a conversation with their king. They were proud that their king had a kind heart.
			After several weeks of travel, the king returned to the palace. He was quite happy that he had visited many pilgrim centres and witnessed his people leading a prosperous life. However, he had one regret.
			He had intolerable pain in his feet as it was his first trip by foot covering a long distance. He complained to his ministers that the roads weren’t comfortable and that they were very stony. He could not tolerate the pain. He said that he was very much worried about the people who had to walk along those roads as it would be painful for them too!
			Considering all this, he ordered his servants to cover the roads in the whole country with leather so that the people of his kingdom can walk comfortably.
			The king’s ministers were stunned to hear his order as it would mean that thousands of cows would have to be slaughtered in order to get sufficient quantity of leather. And it would cost a huge amount of money also.
			Finally, a wise man from the ministry came to the king and said that he had another idea. The king asked what the alternative was. The minister said, “Instead of covering the roads with leather, why don’t you just have a piece of leather cut in appropriate shape to cover your feet?”
			The king was very much surprised by his suggestion and applauded the wisdom of the minister. He ordered a pair of leather shoes for himself and requested all his countrymen also to wear shoes.
			Moral: Instead of trying to change the world, we should try to change ourselves.

He had learnt a lesson from the small boy. At a very small age, this boy was helping his parents, but Raj, in order to meet the demands of his lavish lifestyle, had neglected his parents.
			So, what can we learn from Raj and this poor, small boy?

            <p>Sam was a greedy and selfish man. He always desired to have lots and lots of money and never hesitated to cheat others to make money. Also, he never wished to share anything with others. He paid very low wages to his servants.
			However, one day, he learned a lesson that changed his life forever.
			It so happened that one day, a small bag that belonged to Sam was missing. The bag had 50 gold coins in it. Sam searched high and low for the bag, but could not find it. Sam’s friends and neighbours also joined in the search, but all their efforts were in vain.
			After a couple of days, the ten year old daughter of a man working for Sam found the bag. She told her father about it. Her father identified the bag as the one that was missing, and immediately decided to take it to his master.
			He gave the bag back to his master Sam, and asked him to check whether the bag had 50 gold coins. Sam was exultant to get the coins back, but he decided to play a trick. He shouted at his worker, “there were 75 gold coins in this bag but you gave me only 50! Where are the other coins? You have stolen them!”
			The worker was shocked to hear this and pleaded his innocence. Selfish and greedy, Sam did not accept the worker’s story, and decided to take the issue to court.
			The judge heard both the sides. He questioned the daughter and the worker about the number of coins they had found in the bag, and they assured it was only 50.
			He cross-examined Sam and Sam replied, “Yes my lord, I had 75 gold coins in my bag, and they gave me only 50. Hence, it is quite obvious that they have stolen 25 coins!”
			The judge then asked, “Are you sure that your bag had 75 coins?”
			Sam nodded vigorously.
			The judge then made his judgment.
			“Since Sam lost a bag of 75 gold coins and the bag found by the girl had only 50 coins, it is obvious that the bag that was found does not belong to Sam. It was lost by someone else. If anyone finds a bag of 75 gold coins, I will declare that it belongs to Sam. As there are no complaints about the loss of 50 coins, I order the girl and his father to take those 50 coins as a token of appreciation for their honesty!”
			Honesty will always be rewarded and greed punished!

            <p> Once upon a time, there was an island where all the feelings lived: Happiness, Sadness, Knowledge, and all the others, including Love. One day it was announced to the feelings that the island would sink, so all constructed boats and left. Except for Love.
			Love was the only one who stayed. Love wanted to hold out until the last possible moment. When the island had almost sunk, Love decided to ask for help.
			Richness was passing by Love in a grand boat. Love said, “Richness, can you take me with you?”
			Richness answered, “No, I can’t. There is a lot of gold and silver in my boat. There is no place here for you.”
			Love decided to ask Vanity who was also passing by in a beautiful vessel. “Vanity, please help me!“I can’t help you, Love. You are all wet and might damage my boat,” Vanity answered.
			Sadness also passed close by, so Love asked, “Sadness, let me go with you.”
			“Oh . . . Love, I am so sad that I need to be by myself!”
			Happiness passed by Love, too, but she was so happy that she did not even hear when Love called her.
			Suddenly, there was a voice, “Come, Love, I will take you.” It was an elder.
			So blessed and overjoyed, Love even forgot to ask the elder where they were going. When they arrived at dry land, the elder went his own way. Realizing how much she owed to the elder, Love asked Knowledge, another elder, “Who helped me?”
			“It was Time,” Knowledge answered.“Time?” asked Love. “But why did Time help me?”
			Knowledge smiled with deep wisdom and answered, “Because only Time is capable of understanding how valuable Love is.”

            <p> Nick was a 10 year old boy. He was the only son to his parents. Nick’s father was a very busy businessman who could not spend time with his son. He came home after Nick slept, and was off to office before Nick woke up in the morning. Nick yearned for his father’s attention. He wanted to go outdoors and play with his father just like his friends did.
	One day, Nick was surprised to see his father at home in the evening.
	“Dad, it is a big surprise to see you at home,” Nick said.
	“Yes son, my meeting was cancelled. So I’m at home. But after two hours I have to catch a flight,” his father replied.
	“When will you be back?”
	“Tomorrow noon.”
	Nick was in deep thought for a while. Then he asked, “Dad, how much do you earn in a year?”
	Nick’s father was taken aback. He said, “My dear son, it’s a very big amount and you won’t before able to understand it.”
	“Ok dad, are you happy with the amount you earn?”
	“Yes my dear. I’m very happy, and in fact I’m planning to launch our new branch and a new business in a few months. Isn’t that great?”
	“Yes, dad. I’m happy to hear that. Can I ask you one more question?”
	“Yes, dear.”
	“Dad, can you tell me how much you earn in a day or even half a day?”
	“Nick, why are you asking this question?” Nick’s father was perplexed.
	But Nick was persistent. “Please answer me. Can you please tell me how much you earn in an hour?”
	Nick’s father gave in and replied, “It will be around $ 25/- per hour.”
	Nick ran to his room upstairs, and came down with his piggy bank that contained his savings.
	“Dad, I have $50 in my piggy bank. Can you spare two hours for me? I want to go to the beach and have dinner with you tomorrow evening. Can you please mark this in your schedule?”
	Nick’s father was speechless!
	The greatest gift a parent can give his child is time. Money can’t buy everything!

            <p> Rama’s family is very big. Rama is a hard worker and he is the sole bread winner of the family. He has three kids, two sons and a daughter. He lives along with father and mother. Rama used to work too hard to feed his family.
			He works for more than 16 hours a day. The kids cannot see him as he will leave home early in the morning before they wake-up and reach home around midnight when kids would sleep every day. The entire family eagerly wait to spend quality time with him and the kids miss him so much.  
			The children were too curious about Sundays as his father would spend the entire day with them. Unfortunately, to meet the increasing household expenses and educational expenses, Rama took a weekend job to work even on Sundays. The kids were very shattered and even Rama’s wife and parents too!  
			The typical routine continued for several weeks and year passed. All the hard work of Rama earned a lot of benefits and he was offered promotion with attractive increment.
			The family moved to a new house, got better clothes and ate healthy foods. However, as usual, Rama continues to earn more and more money. One day his wife asked him ‘why are you running for money? We can be happy with what we have now.’
			Rama replied, ‘I want to give the best available in the world to all of you and want you to stay happy always.’  
			Two years passed and Rama hardly spent time with his family. The children yearned to have their father at home. Meanwhile, the sincere efforts of Rama reaped him a fortune. He was offered partnership and share in profits. He continued to earn more and more wealth.  
			Now, Rama’s family is one of the richest families in the city. They have all the facilities and luxuries. Still, Rama’s children strove to meet their father as he was hardly seen at home.  
			His children turned teens and they are no more kids. Now, Rama earned enough wealth to provide a luxurious life to his next five generations.  
			Rama’s family went to their beach house to spend their vacation. His daughter asked, ‘Dad will you please spend one day at home and stay with us here?’
			Rama replied, ‘Yes darling, tomorrow for sure, I will join you for the lunch and be with you all for next few days. I’m tired of work and need refreshment!’
			The entire family became very happy.  
			Unfortunately, the next day, none in Rama’s family were alive as they were washed out in Tsunami!  
			Rama was too busy even to hear the news about Tsunami. When he tried to reach his beach house, he saw sea and water everywhere and screamed for his family, He could not even find the dead bodies of his family.  
			He can never have them again, cannot even see them and even by paying millions he cannot get them back to life!  
			He remembered his wife’s words, ‘Why are you running for money? We can be happy with what we have now.’
			Money can’t buy everything!

			<p> Kim and Ray were very close companions. They were neighbours, classmates at school, and later, colleagues at work.
			One day, they decided to go on a sea voyage to explore strange lands. They began their voyage in a cruise ship, and travelled far and wide. However, in the course of their trip, the weather turned very destructive. The ship was wrecked in the middle of the ocean. Most of the passengers were killed, but Kim and Ray could swim to a nearby island.
			The island was deserted; not even a tree was there. Kim and Ray realized that they could not survive on the island without divine intervention. They decided to pray to God. They wanted to see whose prayer would be more powerful. Kim moved to the eastern tip of the island, knelt down and began to pray there. Ray went to the western tip of the island and prayed there.
			Kim prayed to God to give him food to survive. Surprisingly, he got a pile of food, fruits and vegetables on the sea shore.
			After two days, he requested for a beautiful girl as his wife, as he was feeling very lonely on the island. In a few hours, there was a ship wreck near the island and a lone survivor; a beautiful girl. Kim married the girl.
			Whatever Kim prayed for, was granted to him.
			Almost a month after the ship wreck, Kim decided to move back to his hometown. He prayed to God to send him a ship to take him home. Sure enough, there came a ship to take Kim and his wife home.
			As the couple was about to enter the ship, Kim heard someone speak to him. It was just a voice. “Are you going alone, leaving your companion of life here?”
			Kim was surprised, “May I know who is this and whom you are referring to? I have my wife with me!”
			The voice said, “I’m the one to whom you offered your prayers, whom you requested to save your life, and whom you requested food and shelter and of course, a wife!”
			Kim knelt down in awe and said, “Thank you God!”
			Then Kim remembered about Ray, whom he had forgotten all this time. He was overcome with guilt.
			God said to him, “I was not answering your prayers. I was only fulfilling Ray’s prayers. He prayed for only one thing! He said ‘Please fulfill all of Kim’s prayers’. That was his only prayer.”
			Kim was in tears and rushed to the other side of the island. He realized that he had not even thought about his best friend Ray, and was happily enjoying his own life.
			He could not find Ray there. He asked God, “Where is Ray?”
			God replied, “I took him with me. The man with the golden heart should be with me! But I will fulfill all your prayers as I promised him to do so!”
			Kim was completely broken. He realized why his friend’s prayers were more powerful. It was because Ray’s prayers were totally selfless.
			Moral: Selflessness is the highest form of prayer.

            <p> A group of employees was working in a software company. It was a team of 30 employees. This was a young, energetic and dynamic team with keen enthusiasm and desire to learn and grow. The management decided to teach the employees about finding real solution to the problems.  
			The team was called to play a game in a banquet hall. The group was quite surprised as they were called for playing game. All reached the venue holding various thoughts. As they entered the hall, they found the hall decorated beautifully with colourful decorative papers and balloons all over the place. It was more like a kid’s play area, than a corporate meeting hall.  
			Everyone was surprised and gazed at each other. Also, there was a huge box of balloons placed at the centre of the hall.  
			The team leader asked everyone to pick a balloon from the box and asked them to blow it. Every one happily picked a balloon and blew it.  
			Then the team leader asked them to write their names on their balloon, carefully so that the balloons didn’t blow up. All tried to write their names on the balloons, but not everyone was successful. A few balloons blew up due to pressure and they were given another chance to use another balloon.  				Those who failed to mark their names even after the second chance were ruled out of the game. After the second chance, 25 employees were qualified for the next level. All the balloons were collected and then put into a room.  
			The team leader announced the employees to go to the room and pick the same balloon that had his name on it. Also, he told them that no balloon should blow up and warned them to be very careful!				All 25 employees reached the room, where the balloons carrying their names were thrown here and there. They were searching for the respective balloons carrying their names. While they were in a rush to find the respective balloons, they tried not to burst the balloons. It was almost 15 minutes and no one was able to find the balloon carrying his own name. 
			The team was told that the second level of the game was over.
			Now it is the third and final level. They asked the employees to pick any balloon in the room and give it to the person named on the balloon. Within a couple of minutes all balloons reached the hands of the respective employee and everyone reached the hall.  
			The team leader announced; this is called real solutions to the problems. Everyone is frantically hunting for solutions to the problems without understanding the ideal ways. Many times, sharing and helping others give you real solutions to all problems. 
			Help out each other to ease things.

            <p> Minnu was a sweet, lovable and beautiful girl, aged six years. She was an adorable kid as she always obeyed her elders. Minnu’s parents loved her for her amazing behaviour.
			One day, Minnu’s mother took her for grocery shopping. As they passed the shops, Minnu noted a cute plastic pearl necklace in dazzling pink! She asked her mother to buy her the necklace. Her mother told her that it cost quite a few pennies. She asked her to do some chores, so that for every completed piece of work Minnu would get some money and she could buy the pink necklace.
			Minnu prepared a to-do list and assisted her mom with all the chores. Her mom was very happy, and she paid enough money to buy the pink necklace.
			Minnu happily purchased the necklace and wore it just everywhere, every time, except while taking bath. Her mother said that her neck would turn pink and the pearls would lose their sheen if she wore it while bathing. But all other times, Minnu wore it, even while sleeping.
			Minnu’s father used to tell her bed time stories frequently. One night, after completing a story, her dad asked how much she loved him. Minnu replied, “You know how much I love you.”
			Dad asked, “Then give me your pearl necklace please!”
			Minnu replied, “Please daddy, I love you so much but please don’t ask for these pearls. I will give you the pink Barbie which you bought me a month ago.”
			Dad replied, “Fine, sweetheart.”
			After a few days, the conversation was repeated between Minnu and her dad. Again, Minnu refused to give her pearl necklace and instead asked her dad to take her pet. Dad kissed her and left with smile.
			This was repeated several times.
			One day, Minnu slept while her dad was reading her a story. She was holding the necklace in her hands. Her dad took the pearl necklace from her hand. The next moment, she woke up and asked, “Dad, what are you doing?”
			Dad quickly opened a jewel box placed near her bed and handed her a real precious pink pearl necklace. He said, “Sweetheart, this is your real necklace. I wanted to take away the fake one all this while to give you this real one.”
			She replied, ‘Thank you dad!’
			Minnu immediately gave up her fake necklace for the real one.
			God wants us to give up all the fake and cheap things we consider very precious in our life. It can be habits, hatreds, harming relationships, activities, negative thoughts, etc. He will provide us with genuine things if we give up the fake!

            <p> One hot day, an ant was searching for some water. After walking around for some time, she came to a spring. To reach the spring, she had to climb up a blade of grass. While making her way up, she slipped and fell into the water.
			She could have drowned if a dove up a nearby tree had not seen her. Seeing that the ant was in trouble, the dove quickly plucked a leaf and dropped it into the water near the struggling ant. The ant moved towards the leaf and climbed up onto it. Soon, the leaf drifted to dry ground, and the ant jumped out. She was safe at last.
			Just at that time, a hunter nearby was about to throw his net over the dove, hoping to trap it.
			Guessing what he was about to do, the ant quickly bit him on the heel. Feeling the pain, the hunter dropped his net. The dove was quick to fly away to safety.
			One good turn begets another.

			Why don’t you come and chat with me," asked the Grasshopper, instead of toiling your life away?
			I am helping to store up food for the winter," said the Ant, and I recommend you to do the same.
			Why bother about winter?" said the Grasshopper. "We have got plenty of food at present."
			But the Ant went on its way and continued its toil.
			When winter came, the Grasshopper found itself dying of hunger, while it saw the ants distributing, every day, corn and grain from the stores they had collected in summer.
			Then the Grasshopper knew. MORAL: WORK TODAY AND YOU CAN REAP THE BENEFITS TOMORROW!

            <p> Once upon a time, in a small village, a lazy boy called Jack lived with his mother. He was so lazy that he found it very difficult to move even his fingers. His mother worked as a servant maid in town homes and earned for herself and her son. People started to call him Lazy Jack and Jack’s mother was totally irritated and worried  about her son. 
			One day, she fell sick and was feeling fever severely. She was bed-ridden for two days and could not go to work. She asked her son to earn something for them; otherwise there won’t be anything to eat. 
			Lazy Jack finally understood her mother’s health and their poverty. He promised her mother to bring something and went on to search for a work. 
			A farmer offered him work in his land and paid two pennies for Jack’s work.
			Jack thanked him and rushed to home with the pennies in hand. As he was running to home, he did not notice the pennies rolled down from his hand. He could not find the coins and reached home with unhappy face. 
			He told the incident to his mom. Jack’s mom told him, ‘dear Jack, next time, you put them in your pocket, so that they won’t fall!’
			The next day, a milkman offered Jack a job. Jack was offered a jar of milk as wages for his work. As told by his mother, he poured the milk into his pocket and ran towards his mom.
			His mom recognized what would have happened after seeing Jack’s dress. She told him,’ Jack, you should have carried the milk jar on your head. Don’t worry. But be careful next time!’ 
			Next time also Jack worked for the milkman and he went to the milkman’s farm early in the morning. The work got completed before the noon and Jack was paid a bar of cheese for his work. Jack was happy and as told by his mother, he carried the cheese bar on his head. Since it was a sunny day and very hot in the noon, all the cheese melted away. 
			Jack told his mom that all cheese melted. His mother told, he should have carried the cheese in his hands and asked him to do correctly next time. 
			The next day, he went to work in cattle. The owner of the cattle farm offered him a little kitten for him towards wages as Jack liked the kitten very much. He carried the kitten on his hands. The little kitten jumped from his hands and ran away. Jack was sad and told his mother he lost the kitten too. 
			His mom told, he should have tied a rope and dragged the kitten on the road. 
			For the next two days, he went to work in a farm again and returned home with a huge piece of meat. He tied the meat with a rope and dragged it on the road. The meat was spoiled and his mom shouted at him as he could not do anything properly.
			Later sometime, she consoled him and told him that he should have carried the meat on his shoulders. 
			Jack went to nearby town for work and returned home after a week. For his hard work, he was rewarded with a donkey and he carried the donkey on his shoulders. 
			A young girl around 8 years of age who saw Jack carrying the donkey on shoulders started to laugh and she laughed continuously for long time. Her dad, who was the richest person in the town, was so happy and was in tears. He thanked Jack as he made her daughter laugh after 5 years. Jack realized his mistakes and foolishness he done then and before. But at the same time his foolishness made that rich man’s daughter laugh. He took the rich man and his daughter to his home. The rich man offered them work and shelter in his bungalow. From that incident, he tried to do everything properly without any mistakes and foolishness and they lived happily ever after!

            <p>Once upon a time, there lived a very cunning and mischievous fox. He used to speak to other animals sweetly and gain their trust, before playing tricks on them.
			One day the fox met a stork. He befriended the stork and acted like a very good friend. Soon, he invited the stork to have a feast with him. The stork happily accepted the invitation.
			The day of the feast came, and the stork went to the fox’s house. To her surprise and disappointment, the fox said that he could not make a big feast as promised, and just offered some soup. When he brought the soup out of the kitchen, the stork saw that it was in a shallow bowl!
			The poor stork could not have any soup with its long bill, but the fox easily licked the soup from the plate. As the stork just touched the soup with the tip of its bill, the fox asked her, “How is the soup? Don’t you like it?”
			The hungry stork replied, “Oh it is good, but my stomach is upset, and I can’t take any more soup!”
			“I’m sorry for troubling you,” said the fox.
			The stork replied, “Oh dear, please don’t say sorry. I have some health problem and cannot enjoy what you offer.”
			She left the place after thanking the fox, and inviting him to her house for dinner.
			The day arrived and the fox reached the stork’s place. After exchanging pleasantries, the stork served soup for both of them, in a narrow jar with a long neck. She was able to have the soup very easily with her long bill, but the fox obviously could not.
			After finishing hers, the stork asked the fox if he was enjoying the soup. The fox remembered the feast he himself had given the stork, and felt very ashamed. He stammered, “I…I’d better leave now. I have a tummy ache.”
			Humiliated, he left the place running.
			Moral: One bad turn begets another.

            <p>Neil loves to travel and he was so fond of forests. Whenever he plans for a holiday, he would choose a place that is blessed by Mother Nature. To celebrate his son’s second birthday, he decided to stay and enjoy the celebration in woods, located at the lap of a mountain. He with his family and friends, reached the village located near the woods and had his stay in the cottage. The cottage was located at the entrance of the dense forest, where the guests can view animals roaming in the nearby place. 
			Neil’s son saw a dog at the door and offered him a biscuit. The dog was happy and very soon the little boy befriended the dog. On second day, the birthday of the boy was celebrated grandly in the woods within beautiful nature. The dog did not leave the boy even for a minute and they both became close pals. 
			The next day, Neil, his wife and others decided to go for hunting in the forest and arranged a babysitter to take care of the little for half a day. 
			After 3 hours, all the elders returned to the cottage and they seemed very tired. The dog saw Neil and others, it rushed to them and licked Neil’s shoes. The cottage was open and nobody was there. 
			Neil’s wife was shocked to see the blood stains in the dog’s mouth and she shouted. All of them thought that the dog has killed Neil’s little boy. Everyone was shocked to see the blood-spattered mouth and started to lash the dog. The dog screamed in pain. Neil hit the dog with his gun and it was wounded badly. Hearing the dog’s screaming noise, the babysitter rushed to the entrance with Neil’s son. 
			They were all speechless and enquired what happened to the dog and why blood stains in the dog’s mouth was?
			The babysitter told that the boy was about to get attacked by a wolf which roamed around the house, but luckily it was killed by the dog. She showed the dead wolf to them.
			They felt so bad and offered first aid to the wounded dog.
			Haste makes waste! Decisions made in hurry won’t be helpful.

            <p>One afternoon, a fox was walking through the forest and spotted a bunch of grapes hanging from a lofty branch. Just the thing to quench my thirst, said the fox.
			Taking a few steps back, the fox jumped and just missed the hanging grapes. Again, the fox took a few paces back and tried to reach them, but still failed.
			Finally, giving up, the fox turned up his nose and said, Theyre probably sour anyway. Then he walked away.

            <p>Once upon a time, a man and his wife had the good fortune to have a goose which laid a golden egg every day. Lucky though they were, they soon began to think they were not getting rich fast enough.
			They imagined that if the bird is able to lay golden eggs, its insides must be made of gold. And they thought that if they could get all that precious metal at once, they would get mighty rich very soon. So the man and his wife decided to kill the bird.
			However, upon cutting the goose open, they were shocked to find that its innards were like that of any other goose!

            <p>There once was a speedy Hare who bragged about how fast he could run. Tired of hearing him boast, the Tortoise challenged him to a race. All the animals in the forest gathered to watch.
			The Hare ran down the road for a while and then paused to rest. He looked back at the tortoise and cried out, "How do you expect to win this race when you are walking along at your slow, slow pace?"
			The Hare stretched himself out alongside the road and fell asleep, thinking, "There is plenty of time to relax."
			The Tortoise walked and walked, never ever stopping until he came to the finish line.
			The animals who were watching cheered so loudly for Tortoise that they woke up the Hare. The Hare stretched, yawned and began to run again, but it was too late. Tortoise had already crossed the finish line.
			Moral: Slow and steady wins the race.

            <p>Once when a lion, the king of the jungle, was asleep, a little mouse began running up and down on him. This soon awakened the lion, who placed his huge paw on the mouse, and opened his big jaws to swallow him.
			Pardon, O King! cried the little mouse. Forgive me this time. I shall never repeat it and I shall never forget your kindness. And who knows, I may be able to do you a good turn one of these days!
			The lion was so tickled by the idea of the mouse being able to help him that he lifted his paw and let him go.
			Sometime later, a few hunters captured the lion, and tied him to a tree. After that they went in search of a wagon, to take him to the zoo.
			Just then the little mouse happened to pass by. On seeing the lions plight, he ran up to him and gnawed away the ropes that bound him, the king of the jungle.
			Was I not right? said the little mouse, very happy to help the lion.
			MORAL: Small acts of kindness will be rewarded great.
